That's me

## About me
I'm an aspiring software engineer who very much loves pokémon. 
I'm currently proficient in:
- Java
- Haxe

But I also have some knowledge of:
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML and CSS
- Lua
- C++

#### Note on my name:
The reason I've got so many numbers on my tag is because it's the ID number of my Raichu and also BLAZE IS ALWAYS TAKEN!!!
